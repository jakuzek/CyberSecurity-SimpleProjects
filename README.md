# CyberSecurity-SimpleProjects
Welcome to the Cybersecurity Projects folder! This curated collection features a range of simple Python programs focused on the field of cybersecurity.

# Programs:

  * **Keylogger**<br>
    *A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that records every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. It operates silently in the background, capturing all keyboard inputs, including passwords, emails, chat messages, and other sensitive information.*
    
  * **Image Encryption and Decryption**<br>
    *Image encryption and decryption is a process of securing digital images by converting them into a scrambled format that can only be deciphered by authorized recipients. "Image encryption and decryption" provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface.*
  
  * **Text Encryption and Decryption with Caesar Cipher**<br>
    *The Caesar cipher is a simple, substitution cipher where each letter in the text is replaced with another letter, shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. The program allows users to input text for encryption or encrypted text for decryption, and choose the number of positions by which the alphabet should be shifted. With this tool, users can protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or decipher encrypted messages while maintaining communication privacy. "Encryption and Decryption with Caesar Cipher" provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface.*
    
   * **Live Protocol Graph**<br>
     *This Python code captures and analyzes network packets in real-time. It utilizes the pyshark library to capture packets from a Wi-Fi connection. The main function of the code is to generate a graph depicting the frequency of occurrence of network protocols based on the captured packets. The graph is updated in **real-time**, with each new packet being taken into account. The code also saves the final graph as an image file if the number of captured packets reaches a specified threshold. Overall, this code provides a visual representation of live network protocols and their frequencies, allowing users to monitor network traffic in real-time.*
